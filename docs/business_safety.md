# Business Safety Policy

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the business-safe constraints for follow-up recommendations
generated by this system. The tool is advisory and requires human review.

## 2. Core Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- No threats or intimidation.
- No legal claims or legal advice.
- No implications of enforcement actions.
- No automated sending; a human must review before use.

## 3. Allowed Tone Guidance
- Soft: polite reminder and inquiry.
- Neutral: clear request for payment status update.
- Firm: professional, concise escalation without threats or legal language.

## 4. Disallowed Language Examples
- “If you don’t pay, we will take legal action.”
- “This will be sent to collections if unpaid.”
- “We will report you to authorities.”
- “Your account will be closed immediately.”

## 5. Required Auditability
- Every decision must include an explanation.
- Explanations must list the inputs used and the rules applied.
- Outputs must remain deterministic for the same inputs.

## 6. Human-in-the-Loop Requirement
- All outputs are recommendations only.
- The operator must review, approve, and send messages manually.
